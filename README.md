Serverless Fargate Tasks
------------------------
This Serverless plugin will setup a Fargate cluster and setup services and tasks.
With this plugin it's fairly easy to setup a (long running) task which would hook up to kinesis streams or SQS endpoints.

The (minimal) config is as follows:

```
custom:
  fargate:
    vpc:
      subnets:
        - subnet-1234
        - subnet-5678

    tasks:
      my-task:
        image: 123456789369.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/my-image
```

Of course, you can customize to your hearts desire, here are all the available options:

```
custom:
  fargate:
    # you can put global environment variables here, these will be added
    # to all tasks. Optional of course.
    environment:
      foo: bar

    # you can set the execution role that will be used, this will default to the default
    # role for your account
    role: arn:aws:iam::123456789369:role/ecsTaskExecutionRole

    vpc:
      public-ip: DISABLED  # optional, defaults to disabled
      subnets:
        - subnet-1234
        - subnet-5678
      security-groups:  # optional, defaults to vpc default
        - sg-123456678

    tasks:
      my-task:
        name: ${self:service}-${self:provider.stage}-my-task # default name is be the object key (here 'my-task')
        image: 123456789369.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/my-image
        environment:  # optional
          platypus: true
          # local variables will always override global ones
          foo: wut
          # you can also use cloudformation references with eg serverless-pseudo-parameters
          myArn: #{MyResource.Arn}
        cpu: 512  # optional, defaults to 25% -> 256, see cloudformation docs for valid values
        memory: 1GB  # optional, defaults to 0.5GB
        no-service: true # optional, defaults to false.
                        # If set to `true`, will not create ECS service - tasks may then be executed using AWS API via `run-task`instead.
      
      my-scheduled-task:
        image: 123456789369.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/my-image
        schedule: # If schedule is set, no-service is automatically set to 'true'
          expression: 'cron(0 12 * * ? *)' # See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/ScheduledEvents.html for more options.
          task-count: 2
          platform-version: 1.4.0 #Defaults to 'LATEST' which is 1.3.0 as of now. 1.3.0 does not support ECS volumes.

      # You can register services with Application or Network Load Balancer target groups
      my-task-with-load-balancers:
        image: 123456789369.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/my-image
        loadBalancers:
          # You can use the arn of an existing target group already associated with a load balancer
          - hostPort: 8080
            containerPort: 8080
            arn: ${self:custom.httpTargetGroupArn}
          # If you're using an ELB/target group that you're building in the Resources section of
          # serverless.yml, you may run into an issue where the elb and default listener rule are
          # not created prior to the target group/service. In this scenario you can specify the 
          # logical name of the resource so that the appropriate dependencies can be set.
          - hostPort: 8443
            containerPort: 8443
            arn: ${self:custom.httpsTargetGroupArn} 
            elbResource: "my-task-elb"
```

Advanced usage
--------------
You can override the generated CF resource properties per task with the `override` properties:

```
custom:
  fargate:
    tasks:
      my-task:
        image: 123456789369.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/my-image

        # these are all optional
        override:
          task:
            Foo: BAR
          container:
            Foo: Bar
          service:
            Foo: BAR
          vpc:
            Foo: BAR
          role: ARN
```
